# Python-Challenge
In the folder PyBank and PyPoll, I have added two folders and a Python file. The first one is called "Analyis" which, contains my results that was calculated via the Python Script in a text file. The second folder is named "Resources" which, contains the csv folder that is needed for my Python Script to run through and analyse to calculate the results that I need. Finally the file named "Main.py", is the Python Script I have written up to calculate the results found in the analysis folder.

The Python Script in PyBank, runs through the budget data and analyses it to find me the values that was instructed for me to find. The total number of months included in the dataset. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The Python Script in PyPol, runs through the Election Data and analyses it to find me the values that was instructed for me to find. The total number of votes cast. A complete list of candidates who received votes. The percentage of votes each candidate won. The total number of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
